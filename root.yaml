synopsis: |
  A Javascript library providing basic CS algorithms and data structures. The fundamentals
  of computing with an eye towards doing things The Javascript Way.

overview: |
  Jam provides several common algorithms and data structures that are either lacking from
  the standard library, are not present in older versions of the standard library, or are
  extensions of (but compatible with) functions present in the standard library. Jam's goals
  are to be a fundamental library on which to build your web applications, or indeed own
  libraries. To that end, jam attempts not to pollute the global namespace with many names,
  and any such pollution is controllable.

  Above all else, Jam attempts to implement a best-standards approach to defining prototypes.
  Javascript is, after all, a prototype-based language. `jam.prototype()` is significantly
  better than its competitors, because it doesn't try and shoehorn Javascript into something
  it's not.
