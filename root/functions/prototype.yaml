    - jam.prototype(blueprint)

  returns: Function
  parameters:
    blueprint: An object that has several optional properties.

synopsis: Generates a constructor function that returns a new instance of the specified prototype.

overview: |
  `jam.prototype()` takes an object (`blueprint`) that defines how the prototype will be implemented.
  
  ## constructor function

  `blueprint.constructor` is a function whose parameters are the arguments given on instantiation. If
  this prototype has a superclass, the first parameter is a reference to the superclass'
  constructor function, so base classes may be correctly constructed. This function does not need
  to return `this` - any return value is ignored. `constructor` is optional.


  ``` javascript
  var Dragon = jam.prototype({
    constructor: function(name, age) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
    }
  });

  var henry = Dragon("Henry", 21);
  // 'new' is optional, but allowed
  var oliver = new Dragon("Oliver", 27);
  ```

  ## methods

  `blueprint.methods` is a map, where each key is the name of a method to be defined upon the
  prototype. Each value is the method definition. Method names beginning with an underscore are
  considered "private", and are created as non-enumerable, non-writable, and non-configurable. Of
  course, there is no such thing as encapsulation in JavaScript, so users can still call these
  methods. But we hope they don't.

  ``` javascript
  var Dragon = jam.prototype({
    methods: {
      roar: function() {
        console.log("RAWR");
      },

      _complain: function() {
        console.log("Roaring like that hurts my throat");
      }
    }
  });

  var mortimer = Dragon();
  mortimer.roar();
  ```
